# Gotchas and Environment Quirks

- **Local Integration Testing**: Vitest integration tests for API handlers require Docker to be running, as they spin up a local Postgres container.
- **Deployment Script Workflow**: 
  - The deployment script (`bash packages/infra/deploy.sh`) performs a multi-step process for the full stack.
  - The `apps/admin` deployment requires two passes: one to provision the AWS infrastructure (to get the CloudFront URL) and a second pass to upload the Vite bundle after securely injecting `VITE_COGNITO_REDIRECT_URI`.
- **Apps Ports**: Running `npm run dev` in `apps/admin` explicitly binds to port `5174`, unlike generic Vite apps which default to `5173`. 
- **Type Checking Strategy**: The system firmly enforces strict imports and avoids circular dependencies. Always verify architecture graph constraints with `madge` or `tsc --traceResolution` when modifying the domain model.
